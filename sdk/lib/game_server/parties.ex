defmodule GameServer.Parties do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Context module for party management.
  
  A party is a pre-lobby grouping mechanism. Players form a party before
  creating or joining a lobby together.
  
  ## Usage
  
      # Create a party (user becomes leader and first member)
      {:ok, party} = GameServer.Parties.create_party(user, %{max_size: 4})
  
      # Join a party by ID
      {:ok, user} = GameServer.Parties.join_party(user, party_id)
  
      # Leave a party (if leader leaves, party is disbanded)
      {:ok, _} = GameServer.Parties.leave_party(user)
  
      # Party leader creates a lobby — all members join atomically
      {:ok, lobby} = GameServer.Parties.create_lobby_with_party(user, lobby_attrs)
  
      # Party leader joins an existing lobby — all members join atomically
      {:ok, lobby} = GameServer.Parties.join_lobby_with_party(user, lobby_id, opts)
  
  ## PubSub Events
  
  This module broadcasts the following events:
  
  - `"party:<party_id>"` topic:
    - `{:party_member_joined, party_id, user_id}`
    - `{:party_member_left, party_id, user_id}`
    - `{:party_disbanded, party_id}`
    - `{:party_updated, party}`
  

  **Note:** This is an SDK stub. Calling these functions will raise an error.
  The actual implementation runs on the GameServer.
